### How to load a Dao or multisig alias on HOWL

  1) Mint a DENS name on the DENS site which you plan to use as the Dao alias (Refer to [this](https://github.com/bilalkhan360/howldocs/blob/main/docs/howl-basics/create-user.md#create-a-dens-name) guide for minting a DENS name)
  2) Go to [DA0DA0](https://daodao.zone/) website to create a DAO (or you can use an existing DAO)
  3) Copy your Dao contract (the treasury contract) from DAODAO
