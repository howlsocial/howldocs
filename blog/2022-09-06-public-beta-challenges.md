# Public Beta Challenges 🏆

Here are the $HOWL public beta challenges!

**All challenges start after claim begins. This is targeted for Tuesday 6th September (2022-09-06) at 1300UTC.**

**All challenges end on Friday 9th September (2022-09-09) at 1300UTC.**

**For challenge 1.1. YOU NEED TO ALREADY BE IN THE AIRDROP TO BE ELIGIBLE**. To check this, go to the airdrop claim site. You should be able to see `<your-address> can claim X HOWL` after connecting your wallet. If you are not eligible, you will see `<your-address> was not eligible for the Howl airdrop`

Some challenges will require the team to calculate who won, so winners may not be announced for several days afterward.

## Challenges

The challenges are:

1. ***Posting Challenge*** for Howl Genesis users:
    1. For every HOWL post you make, you will be awarded 1:1 additional HOWL tokens up to 50 extra tokens.
        1. i.e. if you already are eligible for 50 HOWL, you can earn 50 more, for a total of 100.
        2. **NOTE:** *only addresses already in the airdrop are eligible for the additional HOWL*[0]
2. ***Documentation***. Submit a pull-request with your guide to https://github.com/howlsocial/howldocs in order to claim these bounties[1]:

        1. **Claiming:** How to claim your airdrop - 500 HOWL
        2. **Create user:** Create a DENS name, set a primary alias. Include how to update and burn if necessary - 1k HOWL

Notes on challenges:

- [0] once again - this is only open to users already eligible for the airdrop. If you’re not eligible, you will earn nothing by posting, though you’re welcome to try the app and help us test :)
- [1] note that a bounty will only be paid on an accepted pull-request. For now we’re looking for guides in English, and there may be future bounties for translations of those, once we have high-quality guides.

## Bug Bounties

As in the Public Alpha, the Howl team reserve the right to offer discretionary bounties for:

- Bugs (~2k HOWL available for serious bugs)
- Exploits (~4k HOWL available for an exploit)
- Social engineering of the DAO

To report a bug or an exploit you’ve found, use the `public-beta-bugs` channel on Discord.
